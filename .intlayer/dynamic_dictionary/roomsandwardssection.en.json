    "nwingdescription": [
      "The North Wing was opened in 1974, containing six en-suite rooms and a dedicated nursing team. Due to its first-class facilities and five-star accommodation, the North Wing was aptly dubbed “The Hilton on the Hill”. In 2012, the Board of Management initiated the redevelopment of the North Wing to meet the high-end care sought by our clients. It now has 12 suites, developed to the highest international standards with the goal to exceed the guests’ expectations."
